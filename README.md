Diploma Thesis - VÃ¡clav Fanfule

The thesis focuses on an objective evaluation of video quality. It describes
methods for comparison of different version of the same video. I have chosen
several different ways to compare the quality of video and subsequently implemented
these. Using these implemented methods I have also gauged various
codecs with the aim of their relative comparison.
